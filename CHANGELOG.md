## [2.0.0] - 2026-07-01

### 🚀 Major Release — Repo Hardening & Documentation Overhaul

### Added
- **Community Health Files**: `SECURITY.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`, `CHANGELOG.md` — full community infrastructure for open-source contributors.
- **GitHub Issue & PR Templates**: Bug report, feature request, and pull request templates under `.github/`.
- **Binary Integrity Verification**: SHA-256 hash check for `winws.exe` (Windows) and `nfqws` (Linux) at engine startup — prevents binary substitution attacks.
- **Security Contact Information**: `alp@archey.com.tr` and Discord (`852103749228036136`) as official vulnerability reporting channels in `SECURITY.md`.
- **Comprehensive README (EN + TR)**: Full technical documentation in both English and Turkish — covers DPI theory, all zapret desync strategies, every Advanced tab parameter, fooling modes, payload customization, Linux firewall setup, security architecture table, and troubleshooting guide.
- **Remote Preset Sync**: Fetch and cryptographically verify (Minisign) preset definitions from a remote CDN endpoint.
- **TPWS Proxy Mode**: Transparent SOCKS5 proxy via `tpws` as an alternative to raw packet diversion.
- **IPSet File Support**: Target desync rules to specific IP ranges via `--ipset` file path.
- **Advanced Fooling Flags Panel**: Multi-select checkboxes for `badseq`, `badsum`, `md5sig`, `datanoack`, `hopbyhop` (IPv6), `destopt` (IPv6).
- **Custom Payload Fields**: Per-protocol (HTTP/TLS/QUIC) custom fake packet payload strings and file paths.
- **Per-Protocol Desync Overrides**: Independent desync method selectors for HTTP, HTTPS/TLS, and QUIC connections.
- **Second Stage Desync (`--dpi-desync2`)**: Fallback strategy when the primary desync fails.
- **Desync Cutoff (`--dpi-desync-cutoff`)**: Limit desync to the first N data or SYN packets per session.
- **TCP Receiver Window Override (`--tcp-window-size`)**: Force smaller server-sent segments to evade certificate-based inspection.
- **Bind Interface (`--bind-addr`)**: Attach the engine to a specific network interface IP.
- **TLS Split Type (`sni` / `snh`)**: Split TLS ClientHello at the SNI or SNH boundary for precise evasion.
- **Windows Job Object Process Isolation**: `KILL_ON_JOB_CLOSE` flag ensures child processes are terminated on app exit or crash.
- **Network Speed & DNS Traffic Meters**: Real-time upload/download speed and DNS queries-per-second metrics in the Log view.

### Changed
- Removed all `.claude/` AI assistant configuration files from the repository (cleanup).
- Import/Export preset buttons relocated to the Advanced tab header section.
- Kill Switch and Watchdog settings unified under the Advanced tab.
- Default installer mode changed to `perMachine` for system-level binary protection.
- DNS socket read buffer increased from 512 bytes to 4096 bytes (EDNS0 compatibility).

### Security
- Fixed IPC `open_url` command to only accept `http://` and `https://` URI schemes (prevents arbitrary protocol execution).
- Fixed shell command injection in the Linux `pkexec` root wrapper via single-quote argument escaping.
- Enforced 5,000 entry cap on the DNS cache to prevent unbounded memory growth.
- All user-supplied arguments validated against a strict whitelist before being passed to the engine process (`sanitizer.rs`).

### Fixed
- Resolved all NPM advisory CVEs via `npm audit fix`.
- Fixed UI layout and toggle component alignment across DNS, Pattern, and Advanced views.

## [1.1.4] - 2026-06-15

### Added
- Expose all advanced Zapret desync parameters in the **Advanced Settings** tab (including HTTP/HTTPS/QUIC protocol-specific methods, desync2 secondary strategy, desync cutoff limits, bind address, and TCP receiver window sizing).
- Multiple checkbox checklists for TCP desync evasion/fooling flags (`badseq`, `badsum`, `md5sig`, `datanoack`, `hopbyhop`, `destopt`).
- Custom payloads & SNI configurations (TLS custom fake SNI domain, custom payload strings/file paths for HTTP/TLS/QUIC fake injections).
- SOCKS5 Transparent Proxy mode using TPWS, and custom IPSet domain ranges list file parsing.
- Cryptographic startup integrity checks: Vane now verifies the SHA-256 hash of `winws.exe` (Windows) and `nfqws` (Linux) before launch to prevent DLL/Binary substitution.

### Changed
- Relocated **Import** and **Export** profile buttons to the top-right header section of the Advanced tab next to the preset dropdown.
- Moved **DNS Leak Protection (Kill Switch)** and **Auto-Recovery Watchdog** settings into the Advanced tab, simplifying the settings sidebar navigation.
- Changed default installation mode to `perMachine` in the installer configuration to protect engine binaries in system protected directories (`Program Files`).
- Expanded DNS socket reading buffers from `512` bytes to `4096` bytes to handle larger EDNS0 DNS packets.

### Fixed
- Fixed critical security bypass in IPC `open_url` command by restricting URIs to safe HTTP/HTTPS schemes.
- Fixed shell command injection breakout on Linux root executor by properly quoting and escaping arguments.
- Fixed unbounded memory growth in DNS Cache by enforcing a 5,000 active entries limit.
- Upgraded local Vite dev dependencies to completely resolve advisory CVEs.
- Fixed UI layout alignments and corrected toggle components styling across DNS, Pattern, and Advanced view containers.
